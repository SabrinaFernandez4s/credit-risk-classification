# Credit Risk Analysis Report:
Overview:
The purpose of this analysis is to figure out which model can better accurately predict whether a customer is low risk or high risk in terms of credit loans. We are comparing two different models and determining which one is better at predicting.


Bulleted lists:
Model 1:
* Accuracy: 99%
* Precision (0): 99%
* Precision (1): 91%
* Recall (0): 100%
* Recall (1): 85%

Model 2:
* Accuracy: 99%
* Precision (0): 99%
* Precision (1): 99%
* Recall (0): 100%
* Recall (1): 84%


Summary of Results:
Based on the results, I would recommend the second model because the precision for both variables we’re interested in are 99%. In reference to the Confusion Matrix Display, that means that for every low risk customer it predicts, it only predicts 4 as high risk (which is incorrect, but still a relatively low number). In the same accord, that means that for every high risk it predicts as correctly high risk, it only predicts it incorrectly 116 times. My justification for not using the first model is, although it’s a good model in its own accord, since the second model has fewer mistakes than the first one, its the ideal model.
